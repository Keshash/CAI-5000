# Short Gameplay Features
- Tactical pathfinding: Pawns will avoid LOS along the entire path they choose as well as any danger.
- Killbox killer: pawns will avoid killboxes and other funnels. Pawns will dig if they find a path to be too dangerous.
- Light speed reactions: pawns will react to enemies (detect) in less than 0.2 MS.
- Tactical thinking: pawns will retreat, regroup, lure you into simple ambushes and they'll consider their armor and your ability to damage them. They do also consider when selecting an attack target the target's armor and the pawn ability to damage them. Pawns also have a much smarter cover selection system.
